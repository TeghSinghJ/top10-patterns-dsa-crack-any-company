## 1. Sliding Window

The Sliding Window pattern is used to solve problems that involve arrays or lists. This pattern helps efficiently find a subset of data that satisfies certain conditions.

- **Key Problems:**
  - [Maximum Sum Subarray of Size K](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-average-subarray-i/)
  - [Longest Substring with K Distinct Characters](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-substring-with-at-most-k-distinct-characters/)
  - [Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-substring-without-repeating-characters/)

## 2. Two Pointers

The Two Pointers pattern is used to solve problems involving sorted arrays or linked lists. This pattern helps efficiently process data from both ends towards the center.

- **Key Problems:**
  - [Pair with Target Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum-ii-input-array-is-sorted/)
  - [Remove Duplicates](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-duplicates-from-sorted-array/)
  - [Triplet Sum to Zero](https://leetcode.com/problems/3sum/)

## 3. Fast and Slow Pointers

The Fast and Slow Pointers pattern is used to solve problems involving cyclic structures, such as linked lists or arrays. This pattern helps detect cycles and find their lengths.

- **Key Problems:**
  - [Linked List Cycle](https://leetcode.com/problems/linked-list-cycle/)
  - [Find the Duplicate Number](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-duplicate-number/)
  - [Happy Number](https://leetcode.com/problems/happy-number/)

## 4. Merge Intervals

The Merge Intervals pattern is used to solve problems involving intervals or ranges. This pattern helps merge overlapping intervals and perform various interval-related operations.

- **Key Problems:**
  - [Merge Intervals](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-intervals/)
  - [Insert Interval](https://leetcode.com/problems/insert-interval/)
  - [Intervals Intersection](https://leetcode.com/problems/interval-list-intersections/)

## 5. Cyclic Sort

The Cyclic Sort pattern is used to solve problems involving arrays containing elements from a range. This pattern helps sort elements in linear time.

- **Key Problems:**
  - [Cyclic Sort](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-all-numbers-disappeared-in-an-array/)
  - [Find All Missing Numbers](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-all-numbers-disappeared-in-an-array/)
  - [Find the Duplicate Number](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-duplicate-number/)

## 6. In-place Reversal of a Linked List

The In-place Reversal of a Linked List pattern is used to solve problems involving the reversal of linked lists. This pattern helps reverse linked lists in place without using extra space.

- **Key Problems:**
  - [Reverse a Linked List](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-linked-list/)
  - [Reverse a Sub-list](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-linked-list-ii/)
  - [Rotate a Linked List](https://leetcode.com/problems/rotate-list/)

## 7. Tree Breadth-First Search

The Tree Breadth-First Search (BFS) pattern is used to solve problems involving binary trees or graphs. This pattern helps traverse the tree level by level.

- **Key Problems:**
  - [Binary Tree Level Order Traversal](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-level-order-traversal/)
  - [Binary Tree Right Side View](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-right-side-view/)
  - [Minimum Depth of Binary Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-depth-of-binary-tree/)

## 8. Tree Depth-First Search

The Tree Depth-First Search (DFS) pattern is used to solve problems involving binary trees or graphs. This pattern helps traverse the tree branch by branch.

- **Key Problems:**
  - [Binary Tree Path Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/path-sum/)
  - [All Paths for a Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/path-sum-ii/)
  - [Sum of Path Numbers](https://leetcode.com/problems/sum-root-to-leaf-numbers/)

## 9. Two Heaps

The Two Heaps pattern is used to solve problems involving the median of a data stream. This pattern helps maintain a balance between two heaps to find the median.

- **Key Problems:**
  - [Find Median from Data Stream](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-median-from-data-stream/)
  - [Sliding Window Median](https://leetcode.com/problems/sliding-window-median/)
  - [IPO](https://leetcode.com/problems/ipo/)

## 10. Subsets

The Subsets pattern is used to solve problems involving permutations, combinations, and subsets of a set. This pattern helps generate all possible subsets of a set.

- **Key Problems:**
  - [Subsets](https://leetcode.com/problems/subsets/)
  - [Subsets II (contains duplicates)](https://leetcode.com/problems/subsets-ii/)
  - [Permutations](https://leetcode.com/problems/permutations/)
